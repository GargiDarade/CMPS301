Overview of your app (What is it, who is the intended audience, problem statement)

Assignment 1 Problem 1 is the gas station bill generating app
and Problem 2 is the Restaurant bill generating app

Assignment 1 Problem 1 and Problem 2 are console app
Intended audience of Problem 1 are Gas Stations and
Intended audiences of Problem 2 are Restaurants

problem statement
Problem 1: Gas Station
In this program, you will implement the header that will display your gas station
name, types of gas that you can purchase including the price (refer to the sample
output for an example of how you can write your program). After implementing
the header, the program will then ask the user to select gas type, number of
gallons that they would like to fill up. Once you get all the information, you will
multiply the gas price by the number of gallons that they requested to fill and
then you will then output the total price for filling up gas. Then, calculate the gas
price by gallons by sales tax to come up with the total value. Then, ask the user
for the payment method that they would like to settle the transaction, which can
be credit card, debit card, gift card or cash.

Problem 2: Discovery Bay Golf and Country Club Restaurant
In this program, you will be building an order platform where you will be allowed
to order a meal. In this program, you will display the menu and then you will ask
the user for the meal and desert that they would like to order. From there, you
will add the meal and desert to get the subtotal and then you will take the
subtotal and calculate the sales tax. From there, you will add the subtotal and
sales tax and then display the user the total value and then the program should
be terminated. Refer to the sample output for an idea of how the logic should be
constructed

Features of the app
In the both app menu is displayed on screen, you have to choose option from it.
Since this is simple app very limited options are displayed
 

How to run the app
First you have to compile respective .cpp source file, can be done in IDE or by following commands in console window
For Assignment 1 Problem 1 use
g++ Assignment1GasStation.cpp  -o Assignment1GasStation.exe
and for Problem 2 use
